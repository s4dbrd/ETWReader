# ETWReader

ETWReader is a C++ application designed to create an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) session, connect to a specific provider (in this case, `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process`), and read specific event IDs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).

## Overview

This program captures and displays events generated by the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process` provider. The targeted events include:

1. **Start Process (Event ID 1)**: Triggered when a new process is created.
2. **Stop Process (Event ID 2)**: Triggered when a process terminates.
3. **Start Thread (Event ID 3)**: Triggered when a new thread is created.
4. **Stop Thread (Event ID 4)**: Triggered when a thread terminates.
5. **Load Image (Event ID 5)**: Triggered when an image (e.g., DLL or EXE) is loaded into a process.
6. **Unload Image (Event ID 6)**: Triggered when an image is unloaded from a process.

## Usage

### Start ETWReader

To start a trace session and connect to a provider, use the following command:

```
.\ETWReader.exe {SESSION_NAME} {GUID}
```

To delete an existing trace session, add the -d flag:

```
.\ETWReader.exe {SESSION_NAME} {GUID} -d
```

To connect to the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process provider and start a session, use the following command:

```
.\ETWReader.exe GlobalSession "{22fb2cd6-0e7b-422b-a0c7-2fad1fd0e716}"
```
